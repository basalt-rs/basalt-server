This packet includes problems of a difficulty *vastly*
surpassing the capabilities of the average computer
science student. Be wary as these problems will
certainly give you great intellectual trouble. There
is little hope for anyone without a Ph.D in computer
science.

If you decide to attempt these problems anyways, good
luck. You will be rewarded for swiftness in your answers.
